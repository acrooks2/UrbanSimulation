# Urban Growth Model



## Introduction

This model is a partial reimplementation (i.e. without [Self Modification](http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/projects/gig/About/gwSelfMod.htm)) of the Urban Growth Model that was developed by Clarke et al. (1997) called SLEUTH. This model explores urban growth and urbanization process.

The region of study is Santa Fe, New Mexico. The data was obtained from The National Map. The model demonstrates how several raster layers can be used to initialize a NetLogo model. 

Below is the graphical user interface of the model:
