# SIR Models

To compare differnet modeling approaches to the same issue, in this folder you will find 4 models:

* **Cellular Automata** ([SIR_CA.nlogo](SIR_CA.nlogo))
* **Discreet Event Simulation** ([SIR_DES.nlogo](SIR_DES.nlogo))
* **System Dynamics Model** ([SIR_SD.nlogo](SIR_SD.nlogo))
* **Agent-based Model** ([SIR_ABM.nlogo](SIR_ABM.nlogo))

Each explores the spread of a disease using a a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model. For more details about SIR models see: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology>

These models show that while the same general patterns emerge (i.e. disease spread), the reasons for this are very different.

Below is the Graphical User Inteface (GUI) for the System Dynamics Model (see: [SIR_SD.nlogo](SIR_SD.nlogo)).

These models were oringaly created for <https://www.abmgis.org/> and have been updated for NetLogo 6.2.2.
